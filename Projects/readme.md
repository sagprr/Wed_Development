## Technologies Used

The Posture ML project leverages a variety of technologies to provide its functionality:

- **HTML5 and CSS3**: The project's frontend is built using HTML5 for structuring content and CSS3 for styling, ensuring an appealing and responsive user interface.

- **JavaScript**: Real-time posture analysis and interactivity are achieved using JavaScript. It forms the core of the application's frontend functionality.

- **ml5.js**: This machine learning library simplifies the integration of machine learning models for posture detection. It allows us to train and implement posture classification models effectively.

- **p5.js**: This creative coding library is used for rendering graphics and visualizing the real-time posture analysis results in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

- **WebRTC**: Web Real-Time Communication is employed to access the user's camera and provide real-time video input for posture analysis.

- **Node.js**: The application's backend is powered by Node.js, allowing for efficient server-side processing and communication with the frontend.

- **Express.js**: A Node.js web application framework, Express.js is used for routing, server configuration, and handling HTTP requests.

- **Git and GitHub**: Version control and collaborative development are managed using Git and hosted on GitHub, making it easy for contributors to collaborate on the project.

- **npm**: The Node Package Manager is used for installing and managing project dependencies.

- **Custom Machine Learning Models**: Machine learning models are trained using custom datasets to classify and analyze different postures based on real-time video input.

- **Custom Alerts System**: Custom alerts and reminders are implemented using JavaScript to help users maintain good posture habits.

- **Local Storage**: The browser's local storage is utilized to store and track posture data over time for progress monitoring.

This diverse technology stack enables the Posture ML project to provide real-time posture analysis and assist users in improving their posture for better health and well-being.
